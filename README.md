# Overview
This program was created to track the foods that I am eating daily. I wanted to create it in Java so 
I could learn the language and challenge myself. This software is meant to send the info that is 
written in the program to a txt file. Some of that info includes what a person ate, calories, protein,
and carbs consumed.
This software is meant to print a statement.

# Future gaols
*I would like to be able to make food with the same date save in the same section

*Make the program work on the phone and sync it so that whether it's on your computer or phone you can keep
the file updated.

*Add this to my workout program that I created earlier in the semester.
